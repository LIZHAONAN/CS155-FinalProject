Hi grader,

Welcome to Group 18's Pool Game! Below are instructions as how to go about playing the game:

When you enter into the game, you can press "1","2","3" to change different cameras. When you press "3", the direction of the camera is just the direction of the white ball. You can press "A" and "D" to move the direction of the camera (that is the direction of white ball to move). Once you decided the direction for the white ball to move, you can press down the "o" key. At the bottom of the scene, there is a bar. When you press down the "o" key, it will have a blue line which represents the strength to hit the white ball (The longer you press, the larger the strength is). If the white ball goes our of the table, you can press "H" to reset the white ball. If you want to restart the game, you can press "R" to restart the game. At the bottom of the scene, you can see your score. Because there are 15 balls in this game. As long as you hit all 15 balls into the hole, you'll win the game. (At this time, if you want to play again, you can press "R" as well).

Thanks for reading this!

Best,

Group 18
